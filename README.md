# Adusta

Adusta is a local 2-player physics-based game where tanks battle to survive! its based on that game scorched earth. Built on HTML5 Canvas, the game focuses on strategy, precision, and math, incorporating concepts like parabolic motion and angles.

## Gameplay  
- **Objective**: Destroy your opponent's tank while protecting your own.  
- **Mechanics**:  
  - Players control tanks, adjusting their aim and charge to shoot projectiles.  
  - Structures on the battlefield can be damaged and change shape, adding strategic depth.  
  - Each tank starts with 100% health — aim carefully and avoid taking too much damage!  

## Local Multiplayer  
- This is a **local 2-player game**, meaning both players will share the same keyboard.  
- If players are in separate locations, additional software (e.g., remote desktop or keyboard-sharing programs) is required to control the other player’s keys.  

## Controls  
- **Player 1**  
  - Move: `W`, `A`, `S`, `D`  
  - Shoot: `E`  
  - Charge: `Q`  

- **Player 2**  
  - Move: `I`, `J`, `K`, `L`  
  - Shoot: `U`  
  - Charge: `O`  

## Features  
- **Dynamic Environment**: Structures can be destroyed or altered when hit by projectiles.  
- **Educational Purpose**: The game demonstrates principles of projectile motion, including parabolic trajectories and angle-based shooting.  

## Requirements  
- A modern browser that supports HTML5 Canvas.  

## How to Play  
1.  
4. Use the controls to move, aim, and fire at your opponent.  
5. Destroy the opposing tank before your health runs out!  

## Credits  
This project was created as a school assignment to apply mathematical concepts in a fun and interactive way.
